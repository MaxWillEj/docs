# Claude Desktop Setup Guide

After deploying your MCP server on Tydli, follow these steps to connect it with Claude Desktop.

## Step 1: Copy Your MCP Server URL

After your deployment completes on Tydli, you'll see a "Server URL" in your deployment details. It looks like:

```
https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-router/your-deployment-slug
```

Make sure to copy the complete URL including your deployment slug.

## Step 2: Open Claude Desktop Settings

1. Launch Claude Desktop application
2. Click on your profile icon in the top right
3. Select **Settings** from the dropdown
4. Navigate to **Developer** tab
5. Click **Edit Config** button

## Step 3: Add Your MCP Server Configuration

This opens the `claude_desktop_config.json` file. Add your server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-router/your-deployment-slug",
      "transport": "sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "bearer",
        "token": "YOUR_TYDLI_AUTH_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration fields explained:**
- `my-api`: Give your MCP server a descriptive name
- `url`: Your complete Tydli MCP server URL
- `transport`: Use `"sse"` (Server-Sent Events)
- `auth.type`: Authentication type (`"bearer"` for Tydli)
- `auth.token`: Your authentication token from Tydli

## Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop. Your MCP server will now be available!

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

Start a new conversation in Claude and try asking it to use your API:

> "Can you list all the endpoints available in my API?"

Claude should respond with information about your API's capabilities!

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you're having issues connecting:

- **Check server status**: Make sure your MCP server status is "Ready" in your Tydli dashboard
- **Verify the URL**: Ensure you've copied the complete URL including the deployment slug
- **Check auth token**: Verify your auth token is correctly configured and not expired
- **Console errors**: Look for connection errors in Claude Desktop's developer console
- **Restart required**: Always restart Claude Desktop after config changes

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple MCP Servers

You can add multiple MCP servers to the same configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-router/api-1",
      "transport": "sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "bearer",
        "token": "TOKEN_1"
      }
    },
    "another-api": {
      "url": "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-router/api-2",
      "transport": "sse",
      "auth": {
        "type": "bearer",
        "token": "TOKEN_2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

For debugging, you can use the MCP Inspector tool:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-router/your-deployment-slug
```

This will open a web interface where you can test your MCP server's tools and resources.
