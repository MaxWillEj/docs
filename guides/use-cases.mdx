# Real-World Use Cases

Discover how teams are using Tydli to connect AI agents with their APIs and workflows.

## Customer Support AI

**Connect Claude to your CRM, ticketing system, and knowledge base.**

### The Scenario

Your support team handles hundreds of tickets daily. You want AI to help agents find customer information, create tickets, and suggest solutions faster.

### How It Works

Deploy your CRM API, ticketing system API, and knowledge base API as MCP servers with Tydli. Connect them all to Claude Desktop.

### Example Interaction

> **Agent**: "Can you look up customer john@example.com and show me their recent tickets?"
>
> **Claude**: *Uses your MCP servers to:*
> 1. Search CRM for customer john@example.com
> 2. Retrieve customer ID and account details
> 3. Query ticketing system for recent tickets
> 4. Format and present the information

Claude can search customer records, create support tickets, and suggest solutions from your documentation - all through natural conversation.

### APIs You Might Use
- Zendesk, Intercom, or custom ticketing system
- Salesforce, HubSpot, or custom CRM
- Confluence, Notion, or custom knowledge base

## Development Workflow

**Integrate GitHub, Jira, and CI/CD pipelines with AI agents.**

### The Scenario

Developers spend significant time context-switching between GitHub, Jira, and CI/CD dashboards. You want AI to help manage the entire workflow from a single interface.

### How It Works

Deploy GitHub API, Jira API, and your CI/CD platform API as MCP servers. Connect to Claude Desktop or Continue.dev in VS Code.

### Example Interaction

> **Developer**: "Create a new branch, list open PRs, and check build status"
>
> **Claude**: *Uses your MCP servers to:*
> 1. Create a new Git branch via GitHub API
> 2. List all open pull requests
> 3. Check CI/CD pipeline status
> 4. Report back with comprehensive status

It handles all three APIs seamlessly with context awareness.

### APIs You Might Use
- GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- Jira, Linear, or Asana
- CircleCI, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions

## Business Intelligence

**Let AI query your analytics, databases, and reporting tools.**

### The Scenario

Your team needs to pull reports from multiple data sources. Creating custom SQL queries or navigating complex BI tools takes too much time.

### How It Works

Deploy your analytics platform API, database API, and reporting tool API as MCP servers. Give ChatGPT or Claude access.

### Example Interaction

> **Analyst**: "What were our top 5 products by revenue last quarter? Compare to previous quarter."
>
> **ChatGPT**: *Uses your MCP servers to:*
> 1. Query sales database for Q3 2024 revenue
> 2. Query sales database for Q2 2024 revenue
> 3. Calculate product rankings and comparisons
> 4. Format results with insights

ChatGPT can pull sales data, compare metrics across periods, and generate insights without writing SQL.

### APIs You Might Use
- Snowflake, BigQuery, or PostgreSQL
- Tableau, Looker, or Power BI
- Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Amplitude

## E-commerce Assistant

**Connect Shopify, inventory systems, and payment processors.**

### The Scenario

You run an e-commerce business and want to provide customers with an AI-powered shopping assistant that can check inventory, process orders, and handle returns.

### How It Works

Deploy your e-commerce platform API, inventory management API, and payment processor API as MCP servers. Build a custom AI assistant powered by Claude or ChatGPT.

### Example Interaction

> **Customer**: "Do you have the blue widget in size large? If so, I'd like to order 2."
>
> **AI Assistant**: *Uses your MCP servers to:*
> 1. Check inventory for "blue widget size large"
> 2. Verify stock availability (2+ in stock)
> 3. Create order in e-commerce system
> 4. Process payment via payment API
> 5. Send confirmation with tracking info

An AI-powered shopping assistant that checks inventory, processes orders, and handles returns through your APIs - completely automated.

### APIs You Might Use
- Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom e-commerce
- ShipStation, EasyPost, or custom fulfillment
- Stripe, PayPal, or Square

## Additional Use Cases

### Marketing Automation
Connect your marketing stack (email, CRM, analytics) to create campaigns, segment audiences, and analyze performance through AI.

### Financial Operations
Integrate accounting software, payment processors, and banking APIs for automated reconciliation and reporting.

### HR & People Operations
Connect HRIS, payroll, and benefits systems to answer employee questions and automate onboarding.

### Content Management
Link CMS, DAM, and publishing tools to manage content creation, editing, and distribution workflows.

### DevOps & Monitoring
Integrate monitoring tools, cloud platforms, and incident management for AI-assisted operations.

## Building Your Own Use Case

### 1. Identify Your APIs

What systems do you use regularly that have APIs?
- SaaS platforms (Salesforce, Slack, etc.)
- Internal services (databases, microservices)
- Third-party integrations (payment processors, shipping)

### 2. Check for OpenAPI Specs

Most modern APIs provide OpenAPI/Swagger specifications:
- Check API documentation for "OpenAPI", "Swagger", or "API Spec"
- Look for `.json` or `.yaml` spec files
- Use tools to generate specs from API docs if needed

### 3. Deploy with Tydli

1. Create a new deployment in Tydli
2. Upload your OpenAPI spec
3. Configure authentication
4. Get your MCP server URL

### 4. Connect to Your AI

- Claude Desktop: Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`
- ChatGPT: Use custom GPT with MCP support
- Custom app: Use MCP client libraries

### 5. Test and Iterate

- Start with simple queries
- Expand to complex workflows
- Monitor usage and performance
- Refine your OpenAPI spec for better AI understanding
