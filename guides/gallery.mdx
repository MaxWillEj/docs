# Using the MCP Gallery

The Tydli MCP Gallery is a curated collection of pre-configured MCP servers that you can deploy in seconds.

## Deploying from the Gallery

1.  **Browse the Gallery**: Navigate to the "Gallery" tab in your dashboard.
2.  **Select a Template**: Choose from popular services like Stripe, Slack, GitHub, and more.
3.  **Click "Deploy"**: This will create a new private deployment in your account.
4.  **Configure Credentials**: You will be prompted to enter your API keys for the service.
    *   *Note*: Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely. They are never shared with the template creator.
5.  **Launch**: Your MCP server is now ready to use with Claude!

    *   Valid OpenAPI 3.0+ specification.
3.  **Pass Validation**: The spec must be valid and free of errors.

3.  **Go to Settings**: In your deployment dashboard, go to the "Settings" tab.
