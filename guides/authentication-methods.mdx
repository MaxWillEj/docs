# Authentication Methods

Tydli supports all standard API authentication methods. Here's how to configure each one for your MCP deployments.

## API Key Authentication

The simplest authentication method. Your API key is sent with every request, typically in a header.

### When to Use

- Simple REST APIs without complex auth flows
- Internal APIs with static keys
- Services like Stripe, SendGrid, OpenAI

### Configuration Example

```
Header Name: X-API-Key
Header Value: your_api_key_here
```

### Common Header Names

- `X-API-Key`
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- `X-Auth-Token`
- `api-key`

### Example Services

- **Stripe**: Uses `Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...`
- **SendGrid**: Uses `Authorization: Bearer SG.xxx`
- **OpenAI**: Uses `Authorization: Bearer sk-...`

## OAuth 2.0

Industry-standard protocol for secure authorization. Allows temporary, scoped access without sharing passwords.

### When to Use

- APIs that require user authorization (Google, GitHub, Salesforce)
- When you need different permission levels
- Production applications handling user data

### Configuration Fields

- **`client_id`**: Your application identifier
- **`client_secret`**: Your application secret key
- **`token_url`**: Endpoint to exchange code for token
- **`scope`**: Requested permissions (optional)

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "auth_type": "oauth2",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "token_url": "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
  "scope": "read:users write:data"
}
```

### How Tydli Handles OAuth

**Token Refresh**: Tydli handles token refresh automatically. Just provide initial credentials and we manage the rest.

**Secure Storage**: OAuth credentials are encrypted and never exposed to end users.

**Automatic Renewal**: Tokens are refreshed before expiration to ensure uninterrupted service.

## Basic Authentication

Simple username and password authentication. Credentials are base64-encoded and sent in the Authorization header.

### When to Use

- Legacy or internal APIs
- Simple services without OAuth support
- Development and testing environments

### Configuration Example

```
Username: admin@example.com
Password: your-secure-password

Sent as: Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5AZXhhbXBsZS5jb206eW91ci1zZWN1cmUtcGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

### Security Note

**Always use Basic Auth over HTTPS.** Tydli encrypts your credentials at rest and in transit.

## Custom Headers

For APIs with proprietary authentication schemes or additional required headers.

### When to Use

- APIs with custom authentication schemes
- Services requiring multiple authentication headers
- Special tracking or versioning headers

### Example Use Cases

**Multiple auth tokens:**
```
X-Auth-Token: primary-token-here
X-Secondary-Token: secondary-token-here
```

**API versioning:**
```
Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=2
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

**Custom tracking:**
```
X-Request-ID: unique-request-id
X-Client-Version: 1.2.3
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

## Security Best Practices

Tydli implements multiple layers of security for your API credentials:

### Encryption at Rest
- All credentials are encrypted using **AES-256 encryption**
- Stored securely in encrypted database fields
- Never accessible in plain text

### Server-Side Execution
- API requests are made **server-side**, never exposing credentials to clients
- Credentials never sent to browsers or client applications
- All requests proxied through Tydli's secure infrastructure

### Credential Management
- Credentials are **never logged** or displayed after initial setup
- Masked in all UI displays
- Automatic credential rotation support

### Environment Best Practices
- Use **environment-specific credentials** (dev, staging, production)
- Implement different keys for different deployment stages
- Test with sandbox credentials before production

### Rotation & Monitoring
- **Rotate API keys regularly** according to your security policy
- Monitor your Tydli deployment logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Set up alerts for suspicious authentication patterns

### Least Privilege
- Use **scoped permissions** when possible (OAuth scopes, API key permissions)
- Grant only the minimum access required for your use case
- Regularly audit and remove unused credentials

## Troubleshooting Authentication

### 401 Unauthorized Errors

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect API key or token
- Expired OAuth token
- Wrong header name or format

**Solutions:**
- Verify credentials are correctly entered
- Check if token has expired (OAuth tokens)
- Confirm header name matches API requirements

### 403 Forbidden Errors

**Possible causes:**
- Valid credentials but insufficient permissions
- IP address restrictions
- Rate limiting

**Solutions:**
- Check API key scopes/permissions
- Verify your IP is allowed (if API has IP restrictions)
- Review rate limit status
