# Quickstart Guide

## Welcome to Tydli

Tydli transforms any OpenAPI specification into a fully functional Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in seconds. This allows AI agents like Claude and ChatGPT to directly call your APIs.

## The 3-Step Process

### 1. Upload Your API Spec

Paste JSON/YAML, upload a file, or provide a URL to your OpenAPI specification (Swagger 2.0, OpenAPI 3.0/3.1).

### 2. Configure Authentication

Set up API keys, OAuth 2.0, Basic Auth, or custom headers. Your credentials are encrypted and secure.

### 3. Deploy & Use

Get an instant MCP server URL. Configure it in Claude Desktop or any MCP-compatible client.

## Your First Deployment in 60 Seconds

1. **Sign up** for a free Tydli account (no credit card required)
2. **Click "New Deployment"** on your dashboard
3. **Paste your OpenAPI spec** or try our example Petstore API
4. **Name your deployment** and click "Deploy"
5. **Copy the MCP server URL** and configure it in Claude Desktop

That's it! You now have a working MCP server that AI agents can interact with.
