# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tydli platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Comprehensive documentation overhaul with FAQ, security best practices, and rate limits
- Database schema now includes complete `tool_invocation_logs` and `ai_usage_tracking` documentation

### Changed
- OAuth refresh tokens fully implemented and documented (no longer "prepared for future use")
- Documentation now avoids hardcoded counts, references source lists instead
- Consolidated OAuth documentation - USER_GUIDE.md now references OAUTH_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- Trimmed ARCHITECTURE.md to high-level overview with references to detailed docs

### Fixed
- Corrected refresh token implementation status in all documentation
- Added missing `scope` column documentation for `oauth_refresh_tokens` table
- **Type Safety**: Achieved 100% lint-free codebase by resolving all `any` types across backend and frontend.
- **Code Quality**: Improved error handling and type definitions in all Edge Functions and React hooks.

## Release Notes

### Upgrade Instructions

This is the initial production release. No upgrade steps required for new installations.

### Breaking Changes

None - initial release.

### Known Issues

- **OAuth Refresh in Claude Desktop**: Some MCP clients may not automatically use refresh tokens. Workaround: Re-authorize when access token expires.
- **Large OpenAPI Specs**: Specifications over 5MB may take longer to process. Consider splitting into multiple smaller specs.
- **Email Delivery**: Email verification may be delayed in some regions. Check spam folder if not received within 5 minutes.

### Deprecations

None - initial release.

### Migration Guide

Not applicable for initial release. See [USER_GUIDE.md](./USER_GUIDE.md) for getting started instructions.

### Contributors

Special thanks to all contributors who made this release possible.
