### Added
- **Public Gallery Access**: Non-authenticated users can now browse and view gallery MCP servers
- **Gallery Deployment Validation**: Backend validates endpoint availability before allowing deployments
- **Improved Error Messages**: User-friendly error handling for unavailable gallery items

### Fixed
- **Gallery RLS Policy**: Added "Public can view gallery template deployments" policy for anonymous access
- **Deploy Button Error Handling**: Better feedback when MCP server isn't available for deployment

### Security
- Database RLS policies now properly allow public read access to gallery templates while protecting private deployments

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-10

### Added
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into MCP server usage, performance, and errors
  - 4 key metric cards: Total Requests, Success Rate, Avg Response Time, Failed Requests
