# Tydli Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues with the Tydli platform.

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Credential Issues

**Issue**: MCP Server returns 401 Unauthorized
- **Cause**: Invalid or expired API credentials
- **Solution**:
  1. Go to deployment settings
  2. Click "Test Credentials"
  3. If test fails, update credentials
  4. Re-test until successful
  5. See [Credential Troubleshooting Guide](./CREDENTIAL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Issue**: Connection test passed but Claude fails
- **Cause**: Different endpoints have different requirements
- **Solution**:
  1. Check API documentation for endpoint-specific auth
  2. Verify all endpoints in OpenAPI spec use same auth
  3. Test multiple endpoints manually
  4. See [Credential Troubleshooting Guide](./CREDENTIAL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

### File Upload Problems

**Issue**: File upload fails with "Invalid file format" error
- **Cause**: File is not a valid OpenAPI specification
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure file is JSON or YAML format
  - Verify OpenAPI version is 3.0 or higher
  - Check for syntax errors in the specification

**Issue**: File upload stuck at "Uploading..." 
- **Cause**: Network timeout or file too large
- **Solution**:
  - Check file size (max 10MB)
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Use paste method for large specifications

### Validation Errors

**Issue**: "Missing required field: info.title"
- **Solution**: Add required OpenAPI fields:
  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.1
  info:
    title: "Your API Title"
    version: "1.0.0"
  ```

**Issue**: "OpenAPI version must be 3.0 or higher"
- **Solution**: Update version in your specification:
  ```yaml
  openapi: 3.0.1  # or 3.0.2, 3.0.3, etc.
  ```

### Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Deployment stuck in "Generating" status
- **Cause**: Server generation failed
- **Solution**:
  1. Check deployment logs for error details
  2. Verify OpenAPI specification is valid
  3. Try regenerating the deployment

**Issue**: MCP Server returns 404 errors
- **Cause**: Server not properly deployed or stopped
- **Solution**:
  1. Check deployment status is "Ready"
  2. Use "Health Check" to verify server is responding
  3. Restart deployment if needed

**Issue**: "Rate limit exceeded" errors
- **Cause**: Too many requests in short time period
- **Solution**: Wait a few minutes before retrying (see [Rate Limits](./RATE_LIMITS.md) for details)

### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: "Email verification required" error when logging in
- **Cause**: Account email not verified
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check your email inbox for verification link
  2. Click the link to verify your email
  3. Return to the application and log in
  4. If link expired, contact support for new verification email

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" errors when managing deployments
- **Cause**: Session expired or invalid
- **Solution**: 
  1. Sign out and sign back in
  2. Refresh the page
  3. Clear browser cache if problems persist

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Dashboard loading slowly
- **Cause**: Large number of deployments or logs
- **Solution**:
  - Use deployment filters
  - Clear old deployment logs
  - Refresh the page

**Issue**: File validation takes too long
- **Cause**: Large or complex OpenAPI specification
- **Solution**:
  - Simplify specification if possible
  - Break large APIs into smaller specifications
  - Use URL import instead of file upload

## 🔧 Browser Issues

### Compatibility
- **Supported Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **JavaScript Required**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- **Ad Blockers**: May interfere with file uploads

### Cache Issues
If experiencing persistent problems:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Disable browser extensions temporarily
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode

## 📊 Getting Help

### Check System Status
- View deployment logs for detailed error information
- Use health check feature to verify server status
- Monitor deployment dashboard for real-time updates

### Reporting Issues
When reporting problems, include:
- Error messages (exact text)
- Browser and version
- Steps to reproduce
- OpenAPI specification (if applicable)

### Contact Support
- **Documentation**: Check [User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md)
- **API Reference**: See [API Reference](./API_REFERENCE.md)
- **Status Page**: Monitor platform status

## 🔍 Advanced Debugging

### Database Query Debugging

**Check deployment logs for errors:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM deployment_logs 
WHERE deployment_id = 'your-deployment-id' 
AND status = 'failure'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Find slow API endpoints:**
```sql
SELECT 
  path, 
  AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_ms, 
  MAX(response_time_ms) as max_ms,
  COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM request_usage_tracking
WHERE deployment_id = 'your-deployment-id'
  AND response_time_ms IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY path
ORDER BY avg_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check authentication failures:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM deployment_logs
WHERE deployment_id = 'your-deployment-id'
  AND operation = 'authentication'
  AND status = 'failure'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Monitor error rate:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) as hour,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM deployment_logs
WHERE deployment_id = 'your-deployment-id'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY hour, status
ORDER BY hour DESC;
```

**Find requests with errors:**
```sql
SELECT 
  path,
  response_status,
  COUNT(*) as error_count
FROM request_usage_tracking
WHERE deployment_id = 'your-deployment-id'
  AND response_status >= 400
GROUP BY path, response_status
ORDER BY error_count DESC;
```

### Development Mode
For developers using the platform:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Monitor Network tab for failed requests
4. Check Application tab for local storage issues

### API Debugging
- Test MCP endpoints directly using curl
- Verify JWT tokens are valid
- Check CORS headers for cross-origin issues
