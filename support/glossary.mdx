# Tydli Glossary

A complete reference to key terms used across the Tydli platform, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem, and AI–API integrations.  
Each definition is written to maximize clarity and usefulness for teams adopting Tydli.

---

## A

### **Access Token**
A short-lived credential used to authenticate requests to a protected API or MCP server.  
Access tokens prove *who* the caller is and *what* they are allowed to do.

### **AI Agent / AI Assistant**
An application powered by an LLM that performs tasks and calls tools.  
In Tydli, AI agents (e.g., Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, custom agents) connect to your MCP server to interact with your API.

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
A programmatic interface exposed by a service.  
Tydli transforms APIs—whether defined in OpenAPI or extracted from documents—into MCP tools and resources that AI agents can use.

### **API Key**
A static secret used to authenticate to an API.  
Tydli can wrap API-key–based APIs with secure MCP-level OAuth or JWT authentication.

---

## C

### **Callback URL / Redirect URI**
The URL where an OAuth provider redirects the user after authentication.  
Required when integrating OAuth-secured MCP servers with AI hosts.

### **Client (OAuth Client)**
The application requesting access on behalf of a user—typically an AI client connecting to your Tydli-generated MCP server.

### **Client ID**
A public identifier for an OAuth client.  
Used during authorization flows to identify which app is requesting access.

### **Client Secret**
A confidential credential used by private OAuth clients to prove their identity.  
Not used by public clients (like desktop apps) when PKCE is enabled.

### **Connector**
A configuration in Tydli that links an external system (API, SaaS tool, internal backend) to your workspace.  
A connector forms the foundation for generating an MCP server.

---

## D

### **Data Source**
Any external system that provides information—your API, product backend, or external SaaS apps.  
Tydli exposes data sources as resources or tools through the MCP interface.

### **Deployment**
The process of turning a validated API specification into a live MCP server.  
Deployments include authentication settings, server URL, status, and logs.

### **Deployment URL**
The public or private URL used by AI clients to connect to your MCP server.

### **Document Ingestion / AI-Derived Specification**
A Tydli feature that converts product documentation, markdown, or help center text into an inferred API surface that can be exposed through MCP.  
Useful when no clean OpenAPI spec exists.

---

## E

### **Endpoint**
A specific API route (e.g., `POST /tickets`).  
Endpoints are transformed into MCP tools with typed inputs and structured outputs.

### **Environment**
Configuration contexts such as Development, Staging, or Production.  
Each environment can have unique credentials and rate limits.

---

## G

### **Glossary**
A centralized reference for terminology.  
A glossary ensures consistent language across product, engineering, and documentation.

---

## H

### **Host (MCP Host / AI Application)**
The AI application that connects to an MCP server and executes tools.  
Examples: Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Continue.dev, custom LLM agents.

### **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
The protocol used for web APIs.  
Many MCP servers generated by Tydli communicate over HTTP with streaming support.

---

## J

### **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
A lightweight data format used for API requests and responses.

### **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
A signed token used for stateless authentication and authorization.  
Often used by Tydli’s MCP servers when OAuth is not required.

---

## L

### **Least Privilege**
A security principle ensuring each token or integration only has the permissions required—not more.

### **Logs / Request Logs**
A chronological record of tool calls, responses, errors, and performance metrics.  
These enable debugging and monitoring.

---

## M

### **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
An open protocol that defines how AI systems interact with external tools, APIs, and data sources in a secure, structured way.

### **MCP Client**
A component inside an AI host that understands the MCP protocol and can call tools on an MCP server.

### **MCP Server**
A server that exposes tools, resources, and prompts to AI systems.  
Tydli generates and manages MCP servers automatically from your API.

### **Metadata**
Supporting information about tools, resources, or prompts used to help AI hosts understand how to interact with an MCP server.

---

## O

### **OAuth 2.1**
A modern, secure authorization framework used to grant access to AI clients without sharing passwords.  
Supported by Tydli for secure MCP deployments.

### **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**
A structured format (JSON/YAML) for describing REST APIs.  
Tydli ingests OpenAPI specs to generate accurate and complete MCP tools.

---

## P

### **Payload**
The body of a request or response containing structured data.

### **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**
A security layer for OAuth authorization code flows commonly used by desktop and mobile applications.

### **Prompt (MCP Prompt)**
A reusable, named instruction exposed by an MCP server to guide AI behavior with structured patterns.

---

## R

### **Rate Limit**
A limit on how many requests can be sent in a given time window.  
Tydli surfaces rate limits for the underlying API and handles error responses gracefully.

### **Refresh Token**
A longer-lived credential used to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.

### **Resource (MCP Resource)**
A retrievable entity (like a list of users, tickets, or documents) made available via MCP.

### **Resource Owner**
In OAuth, the entity that owns the data or API being accessed—typically your end user or your system.

---

## S

### **Scope (OAuth Scope)**
A named permission describing what a client is allowed to do (e.g. `read:users`).  
Scopes enforce least privilege.

### **Secret / Credential**
Sensitive authentication material (client secrets, private keys, API keys).  
Handled securely by Tydli and never exposed to clients.

### **Self-Syncing Documentation**
A Tydli concept describing documentation that updates automatically as source content changes.  
Ensures that help center content, API definitions, and generated MCP surfaces remain aligned.

### **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
A streaming mechanism used by MCP servers to send incremental results back to AI clients.

### **Specification Validation**
The process of ensuring uploaded or AI-generated specifications are complete and syntactically correct before deployment.

---

## T

### **Tenant / Workspace / Organization**
A logical container in Tydli where users, connectors, deployments, and settings live.  
Used for team-based organization and access control.

### **Tool (MCP Tool)**
An executable operation exposed by an MCP server.  
Examples: “Create User”, “Fetch Order”, “Generate Report”.

### **Transport (MCP Transport)**
The communication channel between an AI host and MCP server, such as stdio, HTTP, or HTTP+SSE.

---

## U

### **User**
A person who has access to a Tydli workspace.

### **User Roles**
Roles like Owner, Admin, Member, or Viewer that define capabilities inside a workspace.

---

## V

### **Validation**
The automated process of checking correctness in specs, credentials, or configuration before allowing deployment.

### **Versioning**
A method of managing API or configuration changes over time without breaking existing integrations.

---

## W

### **Webhook**
A push-notification mechanism used by APIs to notify clients of events (e.g. “ticket created”).  
While not part of core MCP today, webhook behavior is often represented in documentation and can be modeled as resources or events.

### **Workspace**
See **Tenant / Workspace / Organization**.

---

## Y

### **YAML**
A human-readable format often used to author OpenAPI specifications.
