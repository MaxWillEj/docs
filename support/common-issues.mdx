# Common Issues & Quick Fixes

Resolve the most frequent problems quickly with these troubleshooting guides.

## Deployment Stuck in "Generating" Status

If your deployment fails or gets stuck in "Generating" status:

### Check Deployment Logs

Click on your deployment in the dashboard and look for "View Logs" to see detailed error messages. This is often the fastest way to identify the problem.

### Verify Your OpenAPI Spec

Make sure it's valid JSON/YAML. Try using our example Petstore API to test if the issue is with your spec:

- Valid formats: JSON or YAML
- Supported versions: OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger), 3.0, 3.1
- Use validators: [json lint.com](https://jsonlint.com) or [yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com)

### Wait and Retry

If it's been more than 2 minutes, delete the deployment and try again. Our system auto-recovers from temporary issues.

**Still stuck?** Delete the failed deployment and try with a simplified version of your API spec. Add endpoints gradually to identify which one causes issues.

## Getting 401/403 Authentication Errors

Authentication errors usually indicate credential or permission issues.

### Test Credentials Directly

Use curl or Postman to test your API key/credentials against the target API directly to verify they work:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" https://api.example.com/endpoint
```

If this fails, the issue is with your credentials, not Tydli.

### Check Credential Format

Ensure you're using the correct format:

- **API keys**: Just the key value (e.g., `sk_live_xxx`)
- **Bearer tokens**: Don't include "Bearer" prefix in Tydli (we add it automatically)
- **OAuth**: Ensure client_id and client_secret are correct

### Verify Header Name

Double-check the header name matches your API documentation:

- Some APIs use `X-API-Key`
- Others use `api-key` or `apikey`
- OAuth typically uses `Authorization: Bearer`
- Check your API's documentation for the exact header name

**Pro Tip:** Check your deployment logs for the exact error message. It often reveals if it's a credential, permission, or configuration issue.

## Claude Desktop Can't Find My MCP Server

Connection issues between Claude Desktop and your MCP server are usually configuration problems.

### Verify Configuration File

Check `claude_desktop_config.json` for:

- Typos in the server name
- Incorrect URL (must be the complete MCP server URL)
- Missing quotes around strings
- Invalid JSON syntax

Expected format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-api": {
      "url": "https://your-deployment-url",
      "transport": "sse"
    }
  }
}
```

### Restart Claude Desktop

Completely quit and reopen Claude Desktop after making configuration changes. A simple window close may not reload the config.

**Mac**: Command+Q to fully quit
**Windows**: Right-click taskbar icon and choose "Quit"

### Test the URL

Open your MCP server URL in a browser. You should see metadata about your server, not an error:

- Status 200 OK
- JSON response with server information
- No authentication errors (if using public test)

## Getting Rate Limit Errors (429)

Rate limit errors indicate you've exceeded your plan's request quota.

### Check Your Plan Limits

Go to **Settings → Billing** to see your current usage:

- **Free tier**: 20 requests/hour, 1,000 requests/month
- **Pro tier**: 200 requests/hour, 50,000 requests/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

### Optimize Your Usage

Reduce the number of API calls:

- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple requests into one
- **Use pagination**: Limit result sets to what you need
- **Implement caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Optimize queries**: Only request necessary fields

### Upgrade Your Plan

If you legitimately need more capacity, check our [pricing page](/pricing) for plans with higher limits.

## OpenAPI Spec Won't Validate

Validation errors prevent deployment from starting.

### Check JSON/YAML Syntax

Use a validator to verify your spec is properly formatted:

- **JSON**: [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)
- **YAML**: [yamllint.com](https://yamllint.com)
- **OpenAPI specific**: [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io)

### Verify OpenAPI Version

We support:

- OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)
- OpenAPI 3.0
- OpenAPI 3.1

Check your spec's version field:

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0  # or swagger: "2.0"
```

### Test with an Example

Try deploying the Petstore example API first to verify your account setup is working. If that succeeds, the issue is with your specific spec.

### Common Validation Errors

- **Missing required fields**: Must have `info`, `paths`, and `openapi`/`swagger` version
- **Invalid $ref references**: All `$ref` paths must resolve to valid schemas
- **Circular schema definitions**: Avoid schemas that reference themselves
- **Malformed URLs**: Check the `servers` section for valid URLs

## How Do I Test My MCP Server Deployment?

Use the MCP Inspector to test your deployment before connecting to Claude.

### Click "Test with MCP Inspector"

Find this button on your deployment card in the dashboard. It's the recommended first step after deployment.

### Copy and Run the Command

The inspector modal provides a command to run in your terminal:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  https://your-deployment-url
```

**Requirements**: Node.js 18+ installed

### Test in Your Browser

The inspector opens at `http://localhost:5173` where you can:

- ✅ Execute tools with custom parameters
- ✅ View resources and their content
- ✅ Test authentication flows (OAuth/JWT)
- ✅ See real-time logs and errors
- ✅ Verify endpoint responses

### What to Test

1. **Tool discovery**: Verify all your API endpoints appear as tools
2. **Parameter validation**: Test with valid and invalid parameters
3. **Authentication**: Ensure credentials work correctly
4. **Error handling**: See how errors are formatted and returned
5. **Response format**: Verify data is structured as expected

## Prevention Tips

Avoid common issues by following these practices:

✅ **Test your OpenAPI spec** in a validator before deploying
✅ **Verify credentials** work against your API directly
✅ **Start with simple examples** before complex deployments
✅ **Monitor your usage** to avoid hitting rate limits
✅ **Keep specs up to date** when your API changes
✅ **Use the MCP Inspector** to test before connecting to AI
✅ **Read deployment logs** to catch issues early

By following these guidelines, you'll avoid 90% of common issues!
