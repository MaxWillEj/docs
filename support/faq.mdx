# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General

### What is Tydli?

Tydli is a platform that converts OpenAPI specifications into MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that AI agents can consume. It enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with your APIs seamlessly.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI systems to communicate with external data sources and APIs. It provides a standardized way for AI applications to discover and interact with tools and services.

### Do I need coding experience to use Tydli?

No! Tydli is designed as a no-code platform. If you have an OpenAPI specification for your API, you can generate an MCP server without writing any code.

### What format should my API documentation be in?

Tydli accepts OpenAPI 3.0+ specifications in either JSON or YAML format. You can upload a file, paste the content, or provide a URL to your specification.

## Account & Authentication

### Why do I need to verify my email?

Email verification is required for account security. It ensures that only legitimate users can create and deploy MCP servers on the platform.

### I didn't receive the verification email. What should I do?

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Wait a few minutes - emails can take time to arrive
3. Try signing up again with the same email to resend the verification
4. Contact support if the issue persists

### Can I change my email address?

Currently, email changes are not supported through the UI. Contact support for assistance with account changes.

### What's the difference between OAuth and JWT authentication?

- **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** (Recommended): Best for AI agents like Claude Desktop. Provides secure user consent flow, automatic token refresh, and standardized MCP client integration.
- **JWT** (Session-based): Direct authentication using your Supabase session token. Good for testing, custom integrations, and API development. Tokens are tied to your login session.
- **None** (Public): No authentication required - the MCP server is publicly accessible. Usage is still tracked to your account for rate limiting.

## Deployments

### How long does it take to generate an MCP server?

Typically 20-40 seconds from upload to live deployment, including:
- Validation: 2-5 seconds
- Code generation: 10-20 seconds
- Deployment: 5-15 seconds

### Why is my deployment stuck in "Generating" status?

Check the deployment logs for error details. Common causes:
- Invalid OpenAPI specification
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limit exceeded
- Large specification taking longer than usual

If it remains stuck for more than 2 minutes, try stopping and restarting the deployment.

### Can I update an existing deployment?

Currently, deployments are immutable after creation. To make changes:
1. Upload your updated OpenAPI specification
2. Generate a new deployment
3. Update your AI agent configuration with the new URL
4. Delete the old deployment if no longer needed

### How many deployments can I create?

Limits depend on your plan:
- **Free tier**: See your dashboard for current limits
- **Paid plans**: Higher limits and custom quotas available

Check your current usage in the dashboard header.

### Can I make my MCP server public?

Yes! When generating a deployment, select "None" as the authentication method. The server will be publicly accessible, with usage tracked to your account.

## API Specifications

### My OpenAPI spec has authentication. How do I configure it?

After uploading your spec:
1. Tydli automatically detects authentication requirements
2. Configure credentials in the authentication section
3. Credentials are encrypted with AES-256 before storage
4. The MCP server automatically includes credentials in API calls

### Does Tydli support Swagger 2.0?

No, only OpenAPI 3.0+ is supported. You can convert Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0 using tools like [swagger2openapi](https://github.com/Mermade/oas-kit/tree/main/packages/swagger2openapi).

### What if my API doesn't have an OpenAPI spec?

You have two options:
1. **AI Document Processor**: Upload API documentation (PDF, Word, etc.) and Tydli will generate an OpenAPI spec using AI
2. **Manual creation**: Use tools like [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to create an OpenAPI spec from scratch

### Can I upload multiple API specs?

Yes! You can create separate deployments for each API. Each deployment gets its own unique URL and authentication configuration.

## Claude Desktop Integration

### Where do I find the Claude Desktop configuration file?

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If the file doesn't exist, create it with an empty JSON object: `{}`

### Do I need to restart Claude after updating the configuration?

Yes, always restart Claude Desktop after modifying `claude_desktop_config.json` for changes to take effect.

### Claude isn't detecting my MCP server. What should I do?

1. Verify the configuration syntax is valid JSON
2. Check that all URLs are correct (copy from dashboard)
3. Ensure your deployment status is "Ready"
4. Restart Claude Desktop completely
5. Check Claude Desktop logs for error messages

### How do I remove an MCP server from Claude?

1. Open `claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Delete the server entry from the `mcpServers` object
3. Save the file
4. Restart Claude Desktop

## Rate Limits & Usage

### What are the rate limits?

Rate limits vary by plan. Check your dashboard for current limits:
- Requests per hour
- Requests per month
- Deployments limit
- AI processing usage

### What happens if I exceed my rate limit?

You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. The response includes:
- Current usage
- Limit details
- Time until reset (`Retry-After` header)

Upgrade your plan for higher limits.

### How is usage tracked?

All MCP server requests are logged and counted toward your usage quota, including:
- Successful requests
- Failed requests (still consume quota)
- Requests from any authenticated client

### Can I see my usage history?

Yes! View detailed usage analytics in your dashboard, including:
- Requests per deployment
- Response times
- Error rates
- Tool invocation logs

## Security & Privacy

> 🔒 **For comprehensive security details**, see our [Security Documentation](/security/overview) covering encryption architecture, authentication flows, RLS policies, rate limiting, audit trails, and compliance standards.

### How are my API credentials stored?

Credentials are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before storage. They are only decrypted server-side when making API calls - never sent to the client.

### Who can access my MCP servers?

Access depends on authentication method:
- **OAuth**: Only clients you explicitly authorize
- **JWT**: Anyone with your JWT token (keep it secret!)
- **None**: Publicly accessible to anyone

### Can I revoke access to an AI agent?

For OAuth authentication:
1. Go to your deployment settings
2. View active OAuth tokens
3. Revoke specific tokens

For JWT authentication, log out to invalidate all tokens.

### What data does Tydli collect?

Tydli collects:
- Account information (email, profile)
- API specifications (stored encrypted)
- Usage analytics (requests, errors, response times)
- Security events (login attempts, rate limits)

We do not collect or store:
- Actual API responses from your endpoints
- Personal data from your APIs
- API credentials in plaintext

## Troubleshooting

### My MCP server returns 401 Unauthorized

Common causes:
1. **OAuth**: Token expired or not yet authorized
2. **JWT**: Invalid or expired session token
3. **API Credentials**: Incorrect credentials configured
4. **Deployment stopped**: Restart the deployment

Check deployment logs for specific error details.

### API calls are failing with "Tool execution failed"

This typically means the target API returned an error. Check:
1. API credentials are correct
2. API endpoint URLs are valid
3. Required parameters are provided
4. API is reachable and operational
5. Deployment logs for the actual API response

### How do I debug MCP server issues?

1. **View Logs**: Click "View Logs" in deployment card
2. **Health Check**: Click "Health Check" to test connectivity
3. **Test with cURL**: Copy the cURL command and test directly
4. **Check API Status**: Verify your target API is operational
5. **Review OpenAPI Spec**: Ensure endpoints are correctly defined

## Billing & Plans
