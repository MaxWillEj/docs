### What Qualifies as an Emergency

## Support Best Practices

To get the best help:

### Do

✅ **Search first**: Check docs and Discord history
✅ **Be specific**: Provide details, logs, and context
✅ **Be patient**: Remember this is a side project
✅ **Be kind**: Treat helpers with respect
✅ **Give back**: Help others once you've learned
✅ **Share solutions**: Post what worked for you

### Don't

❌ **Don't expect 24/7 support**: Response times vary
❌ **Don't post credentials**: Never share API keys or secrets
❌ **Don't cross-post**: Ask in one place, wait for response
❌ **Don't demand**: Polite requests get better responses
❌ **Don't assume**: Provide context, don't assume knowledge
